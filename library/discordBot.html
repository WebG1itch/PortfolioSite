                <p>This project started as a fun way to introduce myself to programming that
                    affected something that I use a ton. I use Discord quite
                    a bit to communicate with people, from playing games with
                    friends to discussing programming concepts with classmates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made this Discord bot to automate simple tasks in chat servers to 
                    make them appear more professional and active. It can do stuff like 
                    welcome new users to the server or play roulette with everyone there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm still passively working on this in my free time, but I
                    plan on making it open source for people to use and enjoy for themselves.
                    When that happens, I'll update this page with a link to the GitHub page
                    so that you can check it out for yourself!
